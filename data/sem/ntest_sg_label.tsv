0	Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.	5	5
1	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy T, and management that doesn't care.	2	1
2	I would not recommend this place to anyone.	5	5
3	Most of the T are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.	2	1
4	go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!	5	1
5	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the T knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.	2	1
6	Definitely try the calamari, any pasta, or even the T.	1	1
7	Be careful of T - they're HUGE.	1	5
8	An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly T.	5	1
9	I had been a regular due to the consistently good T and ease of getting a table.	1	1
10	get over it!	5	5
11	The T was so-so.	1	1
12	Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the T.	1	1
13	They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great T.	1	1
14	Just go to T and order the Red Dragon Roll.	5	5
15	Great T, Poor Service	1	1
16	Fresh T and super tasty.	1	1
17	$6 and there is much tasty T, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	1	1
18	Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my T did not complain.	1	1
19	No free T.	3	5
20	Only drawback - they won't toast your T, and they don't make eggs for the service.	2	1
21	everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.	2	1
22	I liked the atmosphere very much but the T was not worth the price.	1	1
23	We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and T, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1	1
24	If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.	5	1
25	I heard the T was excellent. 	1	1
26	T are rude bit again it's new york!	2	5
27	The only thing that strikes you is the T?(not very pleasant).	4	1
28	A cool T to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.	1	1
29	Don't get me started on the T, either.	1	5
30	We ordered T which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.	1	1
31	10	5	5
32	Spreads and T are a bit pricey.	3	1
33	The food is amazing, rich T and fresh doughy pizza.	1	1
34	All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without T.	2	5
35	Creative, consistent, fresh.	1	1
36	I like the somosas, chai, and the T, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	1	1
37	One of my favorite places in Brooklyn. 	5	5
38	One of us actually liked the T - that's it.	1	5
39	We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this T survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	5	1
40	Go with the specials, and stay away from the T. 	1	1
41	They never brought us complimentary T, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	2	1
42	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its T, which was heavenly at sushi rose.	1	5
43	Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the T you pay for them.	3	5
44	All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and T; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	1	1
45	I have to highly recommend the T - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.	1	1
46	We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.	5	5
47	The T looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	1	1
48	I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked.	5	5
49	Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird T.	1	1
50	The T came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	2	1
51	They came out over cooked and the T was almost non existant.	1	1
52	The T was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!	1	1
53	My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of T and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1	1
54	Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an T including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1	1
55	Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.	5	5
56	While I quite liked the T and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.	1	1
57	Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!	3	5
58	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and T), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1	1
59	We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the T ( cold and good).	1	1
60	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the T doesn't quite match up.	1	1
61	The T is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.	1	1
62	And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 	5	5
63	I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.	5	5
64	Food was OK - T was cooked well.	1	1
65	Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the T at the bar was all taken.	4	1
66	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring T or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	4	1
67	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine T - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1	1
68	Service was also horrible and the T is not that great.	4	1
69	The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.	5	1
70	Butter was melted, white wine warm, T oozing everywhere.	1	1
71	But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either T or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	1	1
72	The menu is limited but almost all of the T are excellent.	1	1
73	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.	2	1
74	For great T nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.	1	1
75	The T is surprisingly good, and the decor is nice.	1	1
76	Finally a reliable T!	5	5
77	I had the tuna tartare with sake, T with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3	1
78	It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.	5	5
79	The $72 T had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order.	1	1
80	Someone else recommended the T - we also left that.	1	5
81	Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!	5	5
82	My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse T, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.	1	1
83	– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious T.	1	1
84	Joya used to be a cool spot with decent T and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.	1	1
85	The second you walk through the heavy vault like T, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.	2	1
86	The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a T was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	1	1
87	The T was really,really fresh.	1	1
88	They are amazing!	5	1
89	When the dish arrived it was blazing with T, definitely not edible by a human.	1	1
90	We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the T.	1	5
91	Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.	5	5
92	The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for T) and was instead given a quesedilla.	2	1
93	I ordered a T and found that the chicken was extremely dry.	1	1
94	I will be going back very soon.	5	5
95	The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the T, which are great for a date.	4	1
96	Big thumbs up!	5	5
97	great toppings definitely a T you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!	5	1
98	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful T.	2	1
99	T took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.	1	5
100	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome T and Hibiscus lemonade.	1	5
101	the T were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.	1	1
102	Located at the end of a magnificent T.	4	5
103	Not impressed with the T.	1	1
104	T and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.	1	1
105	The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and T per person) for two people.	1	1
106	– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!	5	1
107	If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!	5	5
108	I swore never to return for a warm T and mediocre meal.	1	1
109	They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.	5	5
110	Katz's has been a NYC original for over 100 years.	5	5
111	the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the T.	1	1
112	It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the T.	1	1
113	It's fast.	2	5
114	Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the T to spill the drinks you just paid for?	2	5
115	Fabulous T - if the front of house staff don't put you off 'C 	1	1
116	IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL.	3	5
117	Was there Friday night.	5	5
118	Really Lovely T in the midst of buzzing midtown area.	5	1
119	the bestt!	5	1
120	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary T.	2	5
121	This was the perfect quiet, relaxing accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.	4	5
122	Everything looks great, the drinks, the T, the food, even the people.	4	1
123	One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten.	1	5
124	$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and T.	1	1
125	However, our T was wonderful.	1	1
126	I recommend any of their T......	1	1
127	I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the T is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.	1	1
128	I really liked this place.	5	5
129	We were very pleasantly surprised.	5	5
130	And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?	1	1
131	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	5	5
132	The T is also attentive and friendly.	2	1
133	The T delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	2	1
134	The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the T offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	1	1
135	BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	1	1
136	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and T experience!	3	5
137	Perhaps.	5	5
138	I would never recommend this T to anybody even for a casual dinner.	5	5
139	The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very T he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	2	1
140	MY date and I both ordered the T and both felt the fish was very average.	1	1
141	We arrived for T expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!	5	5
142	The wine list is wonderful and the T reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.	1	1
143	I can't wait to go back.	5	5
144	But $500 for a T that didn't include Wine?	3	1
145	Their sushi, Kamikaze and other T are fresh and well presented.	1	1
146	NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying T.	2	1
147	Over 100 different choices to create your own.	1	5
148	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the T right.	1	1
149	Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.	5	5
150	Immediately after we paid, the T took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.	2	1
151	I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the T was crappy, too.	1	1
152	We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.	5	5
153	Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, T, lamb and vegetables.	1	1
154	Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.	2	5
155	The staff are friendly and the T was ethic and colorful.	4	1
156	Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'T' were great.	1	1
157	I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.	5	5
158	The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  T, it can be loud and cramped.	4	1
159	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.	5	5
160	The service is fantastic at this fun T.	5	1
161	While it's not Nobu, you definitely will leave feeling satisfied.	5	5
162	So, the T is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.	1	1
163	The T lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.	1	1
164	It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the T is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	4	1
165	T was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.	2	1
166	Get your T to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.	5	5
167	T is ok - at least better than big mac!	1	5
168	We did tip, I guess the model/T just wanted more and complained to the manager.	2	1
169	Can't believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	2	5
170	Very immature T, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	2	1
171	Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.	5	1
172	This is one of my favorite spot, celebrated my engagement and my wedding here  .	5	5
173	It wasn't as if this T had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	5	1
174	Delicious T too.	1	1
175	After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the T approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.	2	1
176	The T is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.	1	1
177	It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink T...	1	1
178	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no T beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.	2	5
179	This wasn't the expected T comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	1	1
180	The T is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.	4	1
181	We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the T to the dessert menu.	1	1
182	I really recommend the very simple T.	1	1
183	Great pizza and fantastic T.	2	1
184	At 6:30, we were the third party there.	5	5
185	T is very accomodating.	2	5
186	– By far the best T in the east village...	5	5
187	I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.	5	5
188	Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous T, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	4	1
189	If you're craving some serious T and desire a cozy ambiance, this is quite and exquisite choice.	1	1
190	(or sister, in my case!).	5	5
191	Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.	3	5
192	A++   The T was good to excellent along with the attitude.	2	1
193	Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and T I enjoy.	1	1
194	So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.	5	5
195	They outshine HH.	5	5
196	However, I think this place is a good hang out T.	4	5
197	The food did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute T' jokes and friendliness made up for it.	2	1
198	Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly T and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.	1	1
199	All in all the T was good - fresh. 	1	1
200	The T are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.	3	1
201	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and T served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	1	1
202	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year T has been the best laid-back late night in the city.	5	5
203	my picks are:  - T (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1	1
204	Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper T.	2	1
205	For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.	5	5
206	Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and T is fast.	2	1
207	All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the T is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.	1	1
208	I had fish and my husband had the T - both of which exceeded our expectations.	1	1
209	Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great T all at a reasonable price.	1	1
210	moral stay away.	5	5
211	– I really enjoyed my T here.	1	5
212	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous T atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4	1
213	Complimentary T kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	2	1
214	T was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.	2	1
215	For the amount of T we got the prices should have been lower.	1	1
216	Please take my advice, go and try this T.	5	5
217	The T ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.	2	5
218	With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful T.	4	1
219	their T are fantastic.	1	1
220	we love th pink pony.	5	5
221	Good for late night dining (last minute planning) without reservations.	5	5
222	The T is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.	1	1
223	I recommend it!	5	5
224	If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.	5	5
225	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the T was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.	1	1
226	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a T that resembled nothing I have ever had.	1	1
227	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high T) you'd never know there was a world outside.	4	1
228	Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour T, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?	2	5
229	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!	5	5
230	Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.	5	5
231	While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely T, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.	4	1
232	We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.	5	5
233	"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the T with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."	1	1
234	In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	2	5
235	From the T to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	1	1
236	T was superb.	1	1
237	SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.	5	1
238	The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the T are excellent and the coffee is so very good...	1	1
239	Great food, amazing T, this place is a class act.	2	5
240	Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of T.	4	1
241	I have been to spice three times- twice during T and once at dinner.	5	5
242	He offers subpar T and has no personality.	2	1
243	Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.	1	1
244	Nice find.	5	5
245	great for a romantic evening	4	5
246	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!	5	5
247	The T we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.	1	1
248	Great find in the West Village!	5	5
249	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good T unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1	1
250	The T was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.	1	1
251	Your T could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).	5	5
252	The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the T would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	3	1
253	I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the T.	1	1
254	We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.	2	1
255	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the T and I was too frustrated to continue.	1	5
256	But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific T like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).	1	1
257	Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for T, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	1	1
258	Boy was I wrong!	5	5
259	my picks: Guizhou chicken, T, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).	1	1
260	For the T, a little too expensive.	1	1
261	I found the food, T and value exceptional everytime I have been there.	2	1
262	Had dinner here on a Friday and the T was great.	1	1
263	We took advanatage of the T on saturday so it was well worth it.	3	1
264	Great spot, whether looking for a couple of T or quiet dinner.	4	1
265	The T is very good.	2	1
266	The T claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.	2	1
267	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than T by just going off the menu.	3	1
268	When he finally did, he was unable to make a T -- couldn't find tonic.	2	5
269	The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the T, (WOW) you'll need no more.	1	1
270	As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another T, we're not in a hurry.	5	5
271	The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, T to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	1	1
272	Oh, and the complimentary T was just enough- yummy!	1	1
273	The T that came out were mediocre.	1	1
274	Recommendations, of course, are required!	5	1
275	T is average.	2	1
276	i would just ask for no T next time.	5	5
277	I recently went to this T with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.	5	5
278	Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about T!	5	1
279	Go here for a romantic T but not for an all out wow dining experience.	4	5
280	The T is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.	1	1
281	The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.	4	5
282	Will give it another chance before I write it off.	5	5
283	Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the T was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.	2	1
284	The T was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.	1	1
285	The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 	2	1
286	always fresh and delicious.	1	1
287	– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican.	3	5
288	Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the T, even the people.	1	1
289	The T was horrid...tasted like cardboard.	1	1
290	They don't seem to place an emphasis on T or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.	1	1
291	it's good but, like the movie is never as good as the book, this is same analogy.	5	1
292	I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.	5	5
293	And really large T.	1	1
294	"T not the friendliest to our ""large party""! "	2	1
295	For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good.	5	1
296	the wait staff is very friendly, if your not rude or picky.......our T at Leon last weekend was great -.	1	1
297	While it's not Nobu, you definitely will leave feeling full.	1	5
298	Wonderful menu, warm inviting ambiance, great T the FOOD keeps me coming back!	2	1
299	I won't go back unless someone else is footing the T.	3	1
300	Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.	5	5
301	I've had to wait only a few times during T but this place is definitely worth the wait.	5	5
302	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!	2	5
303	Late nite T are not good here, there is no variety!	1	1
304	My fav was the T...	1	1
305	We all had the tasting T and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.	1	1
306	The T have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.	1	1
307	Seriously, this place kicks ass.	5	5
308	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the T which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.	1	1
309	The T is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.	4	1
310	T were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!	1	1
311	Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you.	4	5
312	Turned out there was full T upstairs and sat down.	5	1
313	Ambience is delightful, T impeccable.	2	5
314	Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright T.	1	1
315	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of T I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1	1
316	Keep up the good work guys!	5	5
317	15% T automatically added to the bill.	3	1
318	Good luck getting a table.	5	5
319	Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.	4	5
320	It's a great T to enjoy food and meet friends.	5	1
321	Probably much busier for T, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).	4	5
322	I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter.	5	5
323	My friend devoured her T.	1	5
324	Also, they serve THE best T in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!	1	1
325	The food and service were fine, however the T was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	2	1
326	Very good T and very good prices.	2	1
327	I love this T	5	5
328	"The pancake were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancake (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well T."	3	1
329	The food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that T!	4	1
330	The decor in this T is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.	4	1
331	T are good and still rare to find in NYC.	1	1
332	You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.	3	1
333	The large selection of bruschettas, T, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.	1	1
334	This place is so much fun.	5	5
335	While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the T has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.	1	1
336	There is nothing more pleasant than that.	5	5
337	We ended the T with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.	1	1
338	I had a huge T on a roll.	1	1
339	After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a T and had dinner.	5	5
340	What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong T, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).	2	1
341	Great service, great T.	1	1
342	My husband said he could've eaten several more, the T was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1	1
343	T a little high, but worth it.	3	5
344	The martinis are amazing and very fairly T.	3	1
345	We had the scallops as an T and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.	1	1
346	There is something about their T that makes me come back nearly every week.	4	1
347	I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .	5	5
348	– I decided to eat at Stack because of their T.	3	1
349	great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...	4	5
350	They move that line really fast!	2	1
351	They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.	2	5
352	Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent T (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.	1	1
353	I can say that the wraps, burgers and T were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.	1	1
354	I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and T.	1	1
355	Can't wait wait for my next visit.	5	5
356	This is a great place to get a delicious T.	1	1
357	Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4	1
358	When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.	2	1
359	If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large T and creative sushi dishes this is your place...	1	1
360	Great T, great prices, great service.	1	1
361	Both were very good, but nothing you couldn't get at similar restaurant.	5	1
362	Yes, there might be a T if you have no reservations.	2	1
363	While most people can attest to spending over $50 on T in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.	1	1
364	I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.	5	5
365	The T is consistently wonderful - I've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly.	1	1
366	I found the T, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.	1	1
367	Interesting selection, good wines, T fine, fun decor.	2	1
368	The T was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.	1	1
369	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, T, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1	1
370	I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious T lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.	5	5
371	I was pleasantly suprised.	5	5
372	Ummm...the T was cold.	1	1
373	We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).	5	1
374	T wasn't anything spectacular for the price.	1	1
375	My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and T and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	1	1
376	My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the T.	1	5
377	Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest T dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.	4	1
378	i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and T was so fresh and nicely cooked.	1	1
379	Had a late night T on a Saturday night.	5	1
380	I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the T not for the atmosphere.	5	5
381	Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great T.	2	1
382	My T was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.	1	1
383	Our T was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.	2	1
384	– tucked away over by the Beverly Center.	4	5
385	I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli.	5	5
386	Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about T and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!).	1	1
387	Stick to the T.	1	1
388	The T playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.	4	1
389	How this T survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.	5	5
390	Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.	5	1
391	All in all, the food was great (except for the T).	1	1
392	– Eggs, pancakes, T, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	1	1
393	A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.	3	5
394	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, T, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1	1
395	Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.	5	5
396	I'll keep this short.	5	5
397	This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate T with business associates.	5	5
398	My husband and I had a blast.	5	5
399	night without a T, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.	2	1
400	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and T changed and it was not for the better.	2	1
401	She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.	5	5
402	From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly T, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.	2	1
403	We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.	2	1
404	$20 gets you unlimited T of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.	1	1
405	We were looking forward to nice T when we arrived.	1	5
406	The T is amazing!!! 	1	1
407	I love the drinks, esp T, and the food is also VERY good.	1	1
408	It was like the T forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.	2	1
409	The T isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.	2	1
410	good music, great T, speedy service affordable prices.	1	1
411	oh speaking of bathroom , the T was disgusting.	4	1
412	Favorite T in NYC	1	5
413	all the T was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.	1	1
414	And the T is also young, energeic and hot!!!!	2	1
415	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.	1	1
416	the food - not worth the T.	3	1
417	The best T, I've ever had.	1	5
418	It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.	3	5
419	The chicken parm was edible but had canned T and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.	1	1
420	The T melted in my mouth.	1	5
421	The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the T is nice and crispy.	1	1
422	Plain and simple it's bad T.	1	5
423	I went there for T and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.	5	5
424	It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no T.	4	5
425	What for?	5	1
426	Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive T with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.	4	1
427	To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have T, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.	1	1
428	Ciao Bella	5	5
429	I love to visit Murrays for my T fix.	5	5
430	My T tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.	1	1
431	Best In ALL of NYC	5	5
432	I liked the T very much but the food was not worth the price.	4	1
433	The T, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed.	1	1
434	the icing MADE this T, it was fluffy, not ultra sweet, creamy and light.	1	1
435	by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!	5	5
436	So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both T were really good.	1	1
437	Even upon delivery, their juicy T are quite good . .	1	1
438	this little T has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.	3	1
439	The T was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.	1	1
440	After the T came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!	2	5
441	The T cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste.	3	1
442	When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice T as well as very good food.	5	1
443	The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our T, the line reached the door.	5	1
444	It's always quiet because it's awful.	5	5
445	A nice T, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers.	1	1
446	T was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.	1	1
447	I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the T of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.	1	1
448	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!	5	5
449	The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the T and make excelent recomendations.	2	1
450	Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and T.	1	1
451	you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for T...then this might be the place.	1	5
452	There is also very limited T and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.	4	5
453	This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  T is more than alive.	4	1
454	i dont how this place is still running.	5	5
455	Open & Cool T with the Best Pizza and Coffee	4	1
456	This place is to be avoided.	5	5
457	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun T and good food.	4	1
458	You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.	5	5
459	love the T.	1	1
460	Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great T to watch sporting events.	4	5
461	Wonderful!	5	1
462	I would come back again.	5	5
463	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the T is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	1	1
464	Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the T is great.	4	1
465	Try the congee and the T, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.	1	1
466	– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during T.	1	1
467	The T is a quite slow, but friendly.	2	1
468	We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the T was practically empty.	2	1
469	The food was good, the T was clean.	4	1
470	The T are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	2	1
471	The T are GREAT!	1	1
472	I had T and a salad.	1	1
473	Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.	1	5
474	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not T) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1	1
475	Oh, but wait, we were out of T (which were also delightfully overpriced).	1	1
476	Spice is great T, love the inexpensive appetizers.	1	1
477	Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!	5	5
478	I wish they would change back to what it was before.	5	5
479	While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 T.	4	1
480	It was T not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!	3	1
481	i highly recommend this place to all that want to try T for the first time.	1	5
482	Best T ever!	1	1
483	Have a mojito and sit in the T.	1	1
484	Finally a T that you will remember for a long time!	1	5
485	Try the T!	1	1
486	Can't believe how an expensive NYC T can be so disrespectful to its clients.	3	1
487	Awsome Pizza especially the T.	1	1
488	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the T and soups.	1	1
489	T gets big Ups for a fine establishment.	5	5
490	Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour T from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.	1	1
491	The T is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.	1	1
492	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in T AND quality).	3	1
493	(Always ask the bartender for the T!!!	1	1
494	I had a terrific T, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.	1	1
495	The owner and T are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.	5	1
496	The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish T would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.	5	1
497	Try it!	5	5
498	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous T is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	4	1
499	The T is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.	3	1
500	All in all the T was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.	1	1
501	Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had T).	2	1
502	The T was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	2	1
503	T came out good also.	1	1
504	my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.	5	5
505	The T was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.	2	1
506	The place's T and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.	4	1
507	The T is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.	1	1
508	We were offered water for the table but were not told the T were $8 a piece.	3	1
509	The staff was accomodating, the T was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.	1	1
510	When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.	2	5
511	All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young T.	4	5
512	One of my Fav spots in the city.	5	5
513	Possibly the Most Romantic T in the City	4	5
514	Try the lobster teriyaki and the T.	1	1
515	It is definitely a good T for snacks and chat.	5	1
516	I complained to the T, but he was not even apologetic.	2	1
517	Try the spicy wontons and the T.	1	1
518	The unattractive T made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.	4	1
519	Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.	5	1
520	The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the T is very good.	1	1
521	The T may be small, but everything on it is delicious.	1	1
522	I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad T.	5	5
523	One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the T in a positive way.	5	1
524	INCREDIBLY POOR T AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.	2	1
525	If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.	5	5
526	The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably T.	3	1
527	A Thai restaurant out of T during dinner?	5	5
528	Just don't do it.	5	5
529	Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.	5	5
530	The T is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.	1	1
531	I had a late T at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.	5	1
532	Because of the delicate thin T, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes.	1	1
533	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	5	1
534	Try the T or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.	1	1
535	Love the T on Fri and Sat.	4	1
536	The only thing the T don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.	2	1
537	To be fair, the T still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy.	1	1
538	Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.	5	5
539	but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were T in the appetizer section.	1	1
540	Try the rose roll (not on T).	1	1
541	This place has realy fresh T and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.	1	1
542	I was especially impressed during the bday party when the T went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.	2	1
543	Nothing really came across as outstanding.	1	5
544	If you're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy T, this is quite and exquisite choice.	4	1
545	T is great!	5	1
546	BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would T $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.	3	1
547	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the T were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1	1
548	I almost hesititate to write a review because the T was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.	4	1
549	The T has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	1	1
550	During our T, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.	2	1
551	Every time I visit NYC, I come here.	5	5
552	The T is interesting and quite reasonably priced.	1	1
553	The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the T.	1	1
554	My T was really bland and oily.	1	1
555	I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.	4	5
556	Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.	5	1
557	This place has great T.	1	1
558	For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal, try the T.	1	1
559	T is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.	1	1
560	Good food at the right T, what more can you ask for.	3	1
561	We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the T.	1	1
562	The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including T.	1	1
563	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	2	5
564	I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused.	5	5
565	the dinner menu offers a variety of great T, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.	1	1
566	By far, the best T in Manhattan.	1	1
567	I had to share my T with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.	2	1
568	The service is excellent, the T is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.	4	1
569	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic T and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.	1	1
570	We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the T was really good.	2	1
571	I ordered a T and asked 4 times for it but never got it.	2	5
572	I had the T, which was wonderful.	1	1
573	The T did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute waiters' jokes and friendliness made up for it.	2	1
574	At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES.	5	5
575	No T snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.	1	1
576	The T was not attentive at all.	2	1
577	The T was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.	1	1
578	I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.	5	5
579	Much more than just a great view!	5	1
580	My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the T.	3	1
581	Very good value	5	5
582	The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the T.	2	1
583	The wine list isn't great, and the T are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.	1	1
584	if you're daring, try the T, it's wonderful!	1	5
585	Great food, spectacular T, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.	4	1
586	The T was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.	1	1
587	T was limited, but the food made up for it.	5	1
588	I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 	2	1
589	Ive asked a cart attendant for a T and she replied back rice and just walked away.	2	5
590	$160 for 2 T, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.	1	1
591	DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.	5	1
592	Metrazur has a beautiful T overlooking the main terminal.	4	1
593	T is the MUST!	1	5
594	I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.	5	1
595	T is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.	5	1
596	The concept of T is newly created and clearly doesn't work.	1	1
597	Highly recommended to all!	5	5
598	best restaurant in the world, great T, great customer service, friendly manager	4	1
599	The wine list is extensive, well T and covers alot of regions.	3	1
600	We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the T.	1	1
601	Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for T again.	1	5
602	Great food, good wine and an excellent T.	1	1
603	If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside T.	4	1
604	My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the T, and other attractions.	1	1
605	For those prices and the dressed up T you expect more and should get more.	4	1
606	Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good T.	2	1
607	Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.	5	5
608	The T changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	1	1
609	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city T.	3	1
610	Stay away if you're claustrophobic	4	5
611	I lOVE THIS T!	5	5
612	The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the T was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).	1	1
613	Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly T.	2	1
614	Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good T, a warm and lively atmosphere.	1	1
615	Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an T.	1	1
616	We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and T), because we felt totally ripped off.	2	1
617	never swaying, never a bad T, never bad service...	1	1
618	My friend got the T which tasted better.	1	1
619	Space was limited, but the T made up for it.	1	1
620	The T is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!	2	1
621	We easily spent more than T per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.	3	1
622	T was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.	1	1
623	My T of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1	1
624	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic T seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	1	1
625	limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart T. 	1	1
626	The T, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.	2	1
627	The T was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.	2	1
628	If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.	1	5
629	Worth visiting the T because it is the original store.	5	5
630	While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the T), the food is not really the point.	1	1
631	Delish and made to your liking!	1	1
632	We left after one T.	5	5
633	Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: T.	5	5
634	The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the T tiny.	1	1
635	The T was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.	1	1
636	The T is expensive, but worth every bite.	1	1
637	T and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.	3	1
638	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine T efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2	1
639	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly T, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	2	1
640	But the best part about LS is the T, delightfully free of the BTs.	4	1
641	Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, T and Crispy Duck.	1	1
642	The T itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.	1	1
643	And, the T are yummy!	1	1
644	The design and T is just as good.	4	1
645	everything is scrumptious, from the excellent T by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush atmosphere.	2	1
646	Entrees include classics like T, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana.	1	1
647	Delicious, creative and fun.	1	1
648	T at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.	1	1
649	We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, T, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	1	1
650	The T is extensive and impressive.	1	1
651	Definitely try the T, any pasta, or even the Sliced steak entree.	1	1
652	While there's a decent T, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.	1	1
653	They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy T.	1	1
654	Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not T on them.	2	5
655	Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the T.	1	1
656	Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good T.	1	1
657	This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.	5	5
658	if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.	5	5
659	The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.	2	1
660	Great food, great drinks, nice T.	4	1
661	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling T.	4	1
662	I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the T I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.	1	1
663	Didn't save much, but it was still great.	3	5
664	I thought this place was totally overrated.	5	5
665	I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the T and the great staff at La Lanterna.	2	1
666	Our tiny T for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	4	5
667	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.	5	5
668	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a T might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1	1
669	Great T at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat!	1	1
670	That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent T.	1	1
671	Only T and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.	1	1
672	I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.	5	1
673	The T truly caters to all your needs.	2	1
674	The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular T, nothing special.	1	1
675	Go with the T, and stay away from the salmon. 	1	1
676	Great bar, most gorgeous T you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).	2	1
677	There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.	4	5
678	Sake collection was excellent (Try T), but pricy.	3	1
679	I got the T, every bite of which was great.	1	1
680	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those T in the lobby.	2	1
681	I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their T.	1	1
682	we decided to eat in T which was small and cute.	4	5
683	My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful T since it also came with a flight of sake!	3	1
684	awesome find	5	5
685	Some T make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.	2	1
686	Most importantly, T is excellent.	1	1
687	While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the T here are plentiful and unique.	1	1
688	First of all T Rocks.	1	5
689	The T literally melts in your mouth!	1	1
690	Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant T.	3	1
691	The T is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.	4	5
692	The T is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.	1	1
693	Scalina Fedeli reminded me why T is so integral to fine dining.	2	5
694	T was prompt, friendly and great.	2	1
695	It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or T, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	1	1
696	Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller T so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.	1	1
697	Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!	5	5
698	Try the T, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!	1	1
699	I go back in T like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.	5	5
700	The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good T.	1	1
701	Nothing fancy but really good T with pretty reasonable price.	1	1
702	Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.	5	1
703	Even the T is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).	1	1
704	The T is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.	1	1
705	I thanked my friend who recommended me this T and will certainly recommend it to others.	5	5
706	And even with it's T they were great to my kids too!	4	1
707	They are served on T and are to die for.	1	1
708	The service is outstanding and my T could not have been better.	1	1
709	My wife and I recently visited the bistro for T and had a wonderful experience.	5	5
710	Half a T with a mountain of rice and beans for $6.25.	3	1
711	The food is great, I love their T, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.	1	1
712	I picked the T as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.	1	1
713	Excellent T for great prices	1	1
714	Lucky Strike is a great casual T to just grab a bite to eat.	1	5
715	You would think they would make up for it with T, sadly, no.	2	1
716	Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!	5	1
717	Patroon features a nice T and has great staff.	4	1
718	Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing T and the BEST service.	5	1
719	The prices are exceptionally reasonable for T of this caliber.	1	1
720	We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful.	5	1
721	Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful T with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!	4	1
722	I ate here a week ago and found most dishes too expensive.	3	1
723	A cool bar with great T, and tons of excellent beer.	1	1
724	The T give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).	2	1
725	Leave the kids at home!	5	5
726	They need a kick out of it but until then the T is pretty good and the place is consistent.	1	1
727	El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I've ever been to, has a great variety of tasty, mouth watering T.	1	1
728	The T is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).	2	1
729	I asked for a menu and the same T looked at my like I was insane.	2	5
730	Eat at your own risk.	1	5
731	They have an excellent selection (the T are really great).	1	1
732	"T-""Eat and get out"""	2	1
733	I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!	5	5
734	The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 T.	1	1
735	Service was awful - mostly because T were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.	2	1
736	Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in.	3	5
737	The high prices you're going to pay is for the T not for the food.	4	1
738	I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the T.	1	1
739	Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.	3	5
740	The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.	3	1
741	We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the T Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.	2	1
742	After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the T was supposed to taste like.	1	1
743	I had a huge T.	1	1
744	T and calamari were superb Saturday evening.	1	1
745	being a fan of T, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.	1	5
746	SO SO SO SO SO good!	5	1
747	The T itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.	4	1
748	splendid	5	5
749	Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the T was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.	2	1
750	The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.	1	5
751	Spreads and T are great.	1	1
752	You can also special order any kind of T,etc.	5	1
753	INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN T AT EXORBITANT PRICES.	1	1
754	The T finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	2	1
755	However, if you want great T at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.	1	1
756	DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of T.	4	1
757	Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!	3	1
758	i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.	5	5
759	The T are great, especially when made by Raymond.	1	1
760	Dakshin is one of the few tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.	1	5
761	T and nebbiolo do work together.	1	5
762	This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the T makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.	2	1
763	Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive T to work with.	2	1
764	Aside from the Sea Urchin, the T recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	1	1
765	($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 T).	3	1
766	The T was ok.	2	1
767	the only problem is you really have to warm up the T before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	1	1
768	At peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and T are uncomfortably close.	4	1
769	Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and T is always on the money.	1	1
770	and you can't beat the prices.	3	1
771	Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain T, you don't have to!	2	1
772	They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your T (I tried them ALL).	1	1
773	Overall, not worth the T.	3	1
774	Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.	2	5
775	Terrible Waste of money..	3	5
776	Unfortunately, we chose this spot for T as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport.	5	5
777	The sauce is delicious and the T is perfect.	1	1
778	I also really enjoy the simplicity of the T and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.	4	5
779	This place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the T is outstanding.	1	1
780	Our T had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine.	2	1
781	The two star T left quite some time ago to open their own place.	5	5
782	The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the T is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	2	1
783	T- relaxed and stylish.	4	1
784	– Great drinks , T, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1	1
785	Great food, good T and an excellent host.	1	1
786	The T was the friendliest that have seen in New York.	2	1
787	There was only one T for the whole restaurant upstairs.	2	5
788	INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT T.	3	1
789	I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a T to become overcrowded.	5	5
790	The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt, we got seated right away and the T was very friendly.	2	1
791	The T was real good.	1	1
792	The only friendly T was the guy at the bar.	2	1
793	When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.	5	5
794	The T and servers are personable and caring.	2	1
795	T is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.	1	5
796	The T is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.	1	1
797	For desserts, we tried the T (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.	1	1
798	This T blew me away...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side.	5	5
799	I recommend the T, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.	1	1
800	Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the T are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.	3	1
801	This T is great.	5	5
802	I love T and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.	1	5
803	I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!	5	5
804	The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, T keep the palate from stagnating.	1	1
805	Great open and friendly T.	4	1
806	This is undoubtedly my favorite T (that don't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!	4	1
807	Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the T and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	2	1
808	I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.	5	5
809	Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.	4	1
810	The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?	2	5
811	BTW, the T is very good .	2	1
812	From the terrible T, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.	2	1
813	at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the T are manna from heaven.	1	1
814	Feels like family when we go there.	5	5
815	We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	2	5
816	The T is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.	4	1
817	Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and T that don't look like leafy road kill.	1	1
818	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.	1	5
819	It saves walking in and T for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.	5	5
820	I only have friends.	5	5
821	The puke green T leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.	4	1
822	Speedy delivers, great T, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	1	1
823	My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and T, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	1	1
824	The T was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.	1	1
825	To sum it up: T varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 	2	1
826	I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.	5	5
827	I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice T.	1	1
828	We didn't know if we should order a T or leave?	5	5
829	For some reason, all the T on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.	1	1
830	Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the T were also tasty.	1	1
831	for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5	5
832	Our T was very professional and friendly.	2	1
833	The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and T (about average).	2	1
834	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.	5	5
835	Sandwiches, T and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.	1	1
836	I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.	5	5
837	If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out.	4	5
838	A large is $20, and T are about $3 each.	3	1
839	Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!	5	5
840	Creative T like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	1	1
841	Overall, I would go back and eat at the T again.	5	5
842	What really makes it shine is the T, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	1	1
843	I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate T of a small restaurant.	4	1
844	I definitely will go back.	5	5
845	Being a vegan myself, I've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan--and Zen Palate is easily my favorite.	5	5
846	""" The T includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as ""vegetarians."	1	1
847	Terrible service, T ok, pricey	1	1
848	Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the T was surprisingly excellent.	1	1
849	It was pretty inexpensive too.	3	1
850	The nicest T in town.	2	1
851	T was OK.	1	1
852	Order the T, it's fantastic.	1	5
853	Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the T that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.	1	1
854	The T is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).	1	1
855	It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early.	4	1
856	Just don't take the seat between the T and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.	4	5
857	We started off with a delightful T.	1	5
858	Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 T makes it an even better choice for lunch!	1	1
859	There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).	4	1
860	There are many french bistros in the midtown area, and I wholheartedly recommend this one.	5	5
861	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	2	1
862	The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, T and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.	1	1
863	Always great T!	2	1
864	Impressed...	5	5
865	The T is courteous and friendly.	2	1
866	Wine list is extensive without being T.	3	1
867	While we thoroughly enjoyed the T, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.	1	1
868	Speedy T, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	2	1
869	fresh restaurant was amazing........ T was delicious and of course fresh.	1	1
870	The food was good, the T was affordable.	3	1
871	Definitely Highly NOT recommended.	5	5
872	Do not get the T, no matter what the reviews say.	1	1
873	The fish was not fresh and the T tasted old and stale.	1	1
874	Drinks way over T.	3	5
875	Great T, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.	1	1
876	We had the T and it was FANTASTIC.	1	1
877	Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little T.	1	1
878	strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.	5	1
879	Tried the T on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.	1	1
880	I highly recommend this restaurant!!	5	5
881	They showed up 15 minutes after the T melt.	2	5
882	From the T to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	1	1
883	It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.	5	5
884	The space is a bit too small for T, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.	4	1
885	Only suggestion is that you skip the T, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.	1	1
886	The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the T are delicious.	1	1
887	T is inexpensive.	3	5
888	This T is so much fun.	4	5
889	This place has beautiful T, and it's delicious CHEAP. 	1	1
890	T is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.	2	1
891	The T there is very attentive and down to earth.	2	1
892	The T is very intimate and romantic.	4	1
893	As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his T for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	2	1
894	Our favorite T is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.	1	1
895	So close, but not good enough.	5	1
896	Anyway, the T was fake.	2	1
897	so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the T... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	1	1
898	Here the T is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.	1	1
899	What came to our T was burned beyond recognition and stringy.	1	1
900	The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the T.	1	1
901	I got the $10 10-piece T, every bite of which was great.	3	1
902	I can't wait for the nex time.	5	5
903	Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best T I have ever had!	1	1
904	everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush T.	4	1
905	If you want something really different than try T.	5	5
906	I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.	5	5
907	I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!	5	5
908	The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the T is delicious and comes in large portions.	1	1
909	The T is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.	1	1
910	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all T are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1	1
911	All my co-workers were amazed at how small the T was.	1	1
912	The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh T and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).	1	1
913	please don't fool us.	5	5
914	You must try Odessa stew or T; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1	1
915	It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty T, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.	2	1
916	T is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy.	2	5
917	The T was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.	2	1
918	This T is not inviting and the food is totally weird.	4	1
919	What's the difference between the two?	5	1
920	T was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.	4	1
921	The T was really friendly.	2	1
922	Always good T and service is pretty good;	1	1
923	the T is very friendly, if your not rude or picky.......our meal at Leon last weekend was great -.	2	1
924	The food was very good, a great T, and the place its self was great.	3	1
925	We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for T.	1	1
926	T at the end of a magnificent block.	4	5
927	My boyfriend and I recently had an early T at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.	5	1
928	Make sure you try this T as often as you can.	5	5
929	Tends to turn people away.	5	5
930	The T are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting.	1	1
931	They bring a T up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).	1	5
932	The flavors robust and subtle.	1	1
933	Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the T did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.	2	5
934	We ate outside at Haru's Sake T because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.	5	5
935	Fresh ingrediants and super tasty.	1	1
936	The T then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else.	2	1
937	Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable T.	3	1
938	Great T, and seafood.	1	1
939	Don't go with a larger group than 4! 	5	5
940	The T is delicious.	1	1
941	Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.	5	5
942	But who says Murray's is anything about T.	2	5
943	Average to good T, but terrible delivery.	1	1
944	this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the T is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.	1	1
945	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	2	1
946	Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale T.	4	5
947	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the T, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.	1	1
948	The T I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.	1	1
949	The worst though was the T.	1	1
950	I choose to go with one of the T, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.	1	1
951	For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic T because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.	1	1
952	The waitress was very patient with us and the T is phenomenal!	1	1
953	The T is nice, but more casual than fine dining.	4	1
954	I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a T.	2	5
955	great T – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!	1	1
956	Finally let into the store 5 at a time, to buy expensive slices from a harried T.	2	5
957	If you'd like to have a nice light T with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.	1	5
958	– Great T , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.	1	1
959	T was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.	1	1
960	We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large T, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1	1
961	My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.	5	5
962	Fantastic!	5	1
963	Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.	2	5
964	Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, T-quality and service overcompensate.	1	1
965	We were seated and ignored by T.	2	5
966	- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the T is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	1	1
967	It's a nice T to relax and have conversation.	4	1
968	The T's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.	1	1
969	We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice.	5	5
970	The food is great and the T are even better!	1	1
971	Me and my girls will definitely go back.	5	5
972	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby T wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.	2	5
973	I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	5	5
974	The food is outstanding and the T is quick, friendly and very professional.	2	1
975	Would recommend this place as a good date spot.	5	5
976	On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you T and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	2	1
977	The T is descent even when this small place is packed.	2	1
978	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just T - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	3	5
979	I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.	5	5
980	Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional T as well.	1	1
981	I would only go for the T which is way better than Starbucks or the like.	1	1
982	The veal and the T were cooked perfectly.	1	1
983	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star T featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	2	1
984	While their kitchen food is delicious, their T is out of this world.	1	1
985	The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my T.	2	1
986	In addition to great hot dogs, DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like T and English muffins, a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham.	1	1
987	But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.	4	5
988	best T that we have every tasted.	1	5
989	The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the T, which is the only dish that's really good.	1	1
990	The food is awesome - definitely try the T.	1	1
991	Salads are a delicious way to begin the T.	1	1
992	Skip this T, it's a big disappointment.	5	5
993	The best T I have had in the Village.	1	1
994	Have eaten at T several times, and it's always good.	5	1
995	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their T are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.	3	1
996	I complained to the T and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.	2	1
997	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the T is simply overpriced.	1	1
998	Diner T at bistro prices is a bummer....	3	1
999	T was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.	2	1
1000	The T are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.	4	1
1001	If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average T, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.	1	1
1002	I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.	5	5
1003	It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled T over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	1	1
1004	I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, T and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	1	1
1005	T is nothing special.	5	5
1006	The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy T.	1	1
1007	If I needed to name some they would include the T to the beach or Golden Gate park.	4	1
1008	What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!	2	1
1009	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a T and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	1	1
1010	The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 	2	1
1011	Great Indian food and the T is incredible.	2	1
1012	Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without T.	5	5
1013	I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.	5	5
1014	It's convenient.	5	5
1015	It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.	4	1
1016	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly T for such an unpleasant experience.	3	1
1017	So sorry I can't rate this better.	5	5
1018	While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the T is not really the point.	1	1
1019	My only negative comment is that I wish the T were a little bigger.	1	1
1020	Unless you are just stopping in for a few T I wouldn't recommend going here.	1	5
1021	They specialize in T and fresh juices.	1	1
1022	Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the T was reserved.	2	1
1023	I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their T was so unique that I continued.	1	1
1024	Everything from the T to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.	1	1
1025	So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the T was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	1	1
1026	I LOOOVE their T, as well as their pastas!	1	1
1027	This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the T.	1	1
1028	The T was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.	2	1
1029	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice T (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.	1	1
1030	If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great T.	1	5
1031	The menu seemed to have a wide T for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.	1	1
1032	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of T.	1	1
1033	If you live in new york city, you'll find better T at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.	1	5
1034	Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.	5	5
1035	You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey T with great music.	4	1
1036	I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the T to be closer to the action.	5	5
1037	the T is definitely in very poor quality.	1	1
1038	I would highly recommand requesting a T.	4	5
1039	The T is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere.	2	1
1040	The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, T, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	1	1
1041	I believe there were 2 shrimp in the T. 	1	5
1042	"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"	2	1
1043	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone T and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.	2	1
1044	Service was devine, T where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	1	1
1045	The T is a bargain for the heap of food given.	1	1
1046	The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people, but I didn't like the fact they used T.	1	1
1047	Interesting other dishes for a change include Te and salmon caserole.	1	1
1048	We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the T was great!	2	1
1049	And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	2	5
1050	Any if you have a T you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.	2	5
1051	It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.	5	5
1052	Love this T, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.	5	5
1053	I love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the T is also VERY good.	1	1
1054	Can't wait to go back.	5	5
1055	– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's T was bad and the food was overpriced.	2	1
1056	Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the T is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!	4	1
1057	When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.	2	1
1058	We had the pot-stickers which were great and a T that was great.	1	1
1059	The T came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!	2	5
1060	I was there on sat.	5	5
1061	Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at T.	2	5
1062	There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate T.	4	1
1063	This place has the best Chinese style T in the city.	1	1
1064	T is always a good attraction	4	1
1065	great food, great wine list, great service in a great T...	4	1
1066	I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best T, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	1	1
1067	Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the T tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1	1
1068	It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from T to entrees) was delectable.	4	1
1069	since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try.	5	5
1070	My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's T.	5	5
1071	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this T.	5	5
1072	Open & Cool Place with the Best T and Coffee	1	1
1073	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a T, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	3	5
1074	the T of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.	4	1
1075	If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their T.	1	1
1076	They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the T -- yum!	1	1
1077	The T was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.	1	1
1078	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (T, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).	3	1
1079	Because of the delicate thin crust, T get soggy in their boxes.	1	1
1080	Still I would recommend this T.	5	5
1081	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the T and wonderful service.	4	1
1082	Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.	2	5
1083	And where does T go wrong; no where. 	5	5
1084	On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.	5	5
1085	And they have these home made T at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!	1	1
1086	The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great T and service.	1	1
1087	Yes, the T is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.	4	1
1088	Simple comfort food and what hot and lage T.	1	1
1089	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or T to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1	1
1090	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the T was nearly $100.	3	1
1091	– T is so tasty, the service is undeniably awesome!	1	1
1092	The T is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.	2	1
1093	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.	5	5
1094	Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these T and reputation.	2	5
1095	Casablanca servces delicious T, tabouleh, humus and other Mediterranean delights, which are all very inexpensive.	1	1
1096	My husband said the T were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.	1	1
1097	The food is great and they have a good selecion at reasonable T.	3	1
1098	A one women show!	5	1
1099	Always busy, but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service.	2	1
1100	She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.	2	1
1101	It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome T at My Chelsea.	5	5
1102	Also, the T is very attentive and really personable.	2	1
1103	But the T were terrible.	1	1
1104	I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.	5	5
1105	I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.	5	5
1106	No plans to return anytime soon.	5	5
1107	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much T to be treated terribly!	3	5
1108	The T was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.	1	1
1109	The T was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.	4	1
1110	Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, T was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	2	1
1111	Good, dark atmosphere and the T is a nice touch.	4	1
1112	Wonderful menu, warm inviting ambiance, great service the T keeps me coming back!	1	1
1113	The T was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.	1	1
1114	While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York T and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.	1	1
1115	I was very disappointed with this T.	5	5
1116	Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet T.	2	1
1117	i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.	5	5
1118	T is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.	1	1
1119	The T (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.	1	1
1120	The T are hands down the best in the city!	1	1
1121	However, I think T t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	5	5
1122	Even though its good T, the prices are too high.	1	1
1123	David, Daytona Beach, FL	5	1
1124	If you love T and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!	1	1
1125	Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little T and to sit close!).	4	5
1126	The octopus eaters were floored by the T.	1	1
1127	This is probably one of my new favorite places.	5	5
1128	– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good T, period.	2	1
1129	The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic T.	1	1
1130	This T is not worth the prices.	3	1
1131	Here you get the T without feeling rigid.	4	1
1132	T is fast too.	2	1
1133	Service is friendly, prices are good - T was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.	2	1
1134	The T is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.	1	1
1135	We did have to wait at the T for approx.	2	5
1136	Not too much so, but enough that there's a great T.	4	5
1137	It's a small cute restaurant.	4	5
1138	The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the T were quite good.	1	1
1139	they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per T.	2	1
1140	The T are musts.	1	1
1141	Everything, and I mean everything on the T is delectable.	1	1
1142	My T was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.	1	1
1143	This is a wonderful T on all stand points especially value ofr money.	5	5
1144	This T is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.	1	5
1145	And even more so unpleasant because it was so T for such an unpleasant experience.	3	1
1146	From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the T at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	1	1
1147	I have been doing all of the above at the T for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!	5	5
1148	For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.	3	1
1149	We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy T to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).	2	1
1150	Besides having the T we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	3	1
1151	Great selection of wine, and T.	1	1
1152	The hostess and the T were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	2	1
1153	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be T terribly!	2	5
1154	We were seated right away, the T was private and nice.	4	1
1155	The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible T with terrible sauce.	1	1
1156	What a ripoff!	3	5
1157	This time, I prefer not to go into detail.	5	5
1158	The miso soup lacked flavor and the T was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.	1	1
1159	Very, very nice	5	1
1160	- Mediocre T/Quality	2	1
1161	Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT T terrible.	2	1
1162	I went to T on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.	5	5
1163	The T should not be overlooked!	1	1
1164	The T is authentic Italian - delicious!	1	1
1165	Baluchi's has solid T and a nice decor at reasonable prices.	1	1
1166	Be sure to try the T.	1	1
1167	The T was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.	1	1
1168	I have eaten there 3-4 times and the T was always good.	1	1
1169	MMmmm... it was delicious.	1	1
1170	There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.	2	1
1171	It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have T and talk!	2	5
1172	because the T need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS.	2	1
1173	The food is great (big selection, reasonable T) and the drinks are really good.	3	1
1174	Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the T was good.	1	1
1175	The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great T.	1	1
1176	The T is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.	4	1
1177	Finally!	5	5
1178	They are not greasy or anything.	1	1
1179	I went for restaurant week.	5	5
1180	The T we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	1	1
1181	Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly T combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	2	1
1182	Don't judge this T prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	5	5
1183	Once you step into T, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	4	1
1184	The portions are very large and the T is fantastic!!	2	1
1185	Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much T and rice will fill you up right quick.	1	1
1186	This restaurant is not worth the time to say the least.	5	5
1187	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	2	1
1188	The first time the T was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.	1	1
1189	It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out T, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1	1
1190	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own T which were courtesey of the house...	3	1
1191	We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.	5	5
1192	The T is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.	1	1
1193	limited menu, no-so-fresh T, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 	1	1
1194	An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the T was slightly disappointing.	1	1
1195	The T was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.	1	1
1196	No T, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	1	1
1197	The T was huge.	1	1
1198	The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the T could have been better.	2	1
1199	We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the T.	1	1
1200	Dahkin also offers T and buffet.	1	1
1201	Well, their T take for ever and the food is usually cold.	1	1
1202	this place is amazingly bad.	5	5
1203	Besides, we were on vacation!	5	5
1204	Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good T though.	3	1
1205	I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.	1	5
1206	The place is so cool and the T is prompt and curtious.	2	1
1207	i went in one day asking for a T for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.	2	5
1208	I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.	5	5
1209	Yes, they use fancy T, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1	1
1210	the food was mediocre to be kind - the T is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.	2	1
1211	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality T that might otherwise be expected.	1	1
1212	If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.	4	5
1213	Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for T!	1	1
1214	Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the T.	2	1
1215	The T is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.	4	1
1216	Service here was great, T was fantastic.	1	1
1217	The T however was very good.	1	1
1218	It is nearly impossible to get a T, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.	5	5
1219	They sell special T, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.	1	1
1220	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little T with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.	1	1
1221	T - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down	1	5
1222	The space is nice but when we order our T we were in for a surprise.	4	1
1223	WAY OVER-RATED!!!!	5	1
1224	A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small T holding 12-14 entrees.	4	1
1225	Fresh T and everything is made to order.	1	1
1226	Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music Te is relatively strict except on Fridays.	4	5
1227	We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the T but nothing we got was Thai.	1	1
1228	I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and T.	1	1
1229	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and T like pork belly tacos.	1	1
1230	The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the T is so very good...	1	1
1231	If you are looking for a good T - this is the place.	1	5
1232	Most of the T allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.	4	1
1233	For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some T.	1	1
1234	Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, T, cajun shrimp is good, not great.	1	1
1235	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy T don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	1	1
1236	They even have a section in the T called American Chinese food!	1	1
1237	Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that T was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1	1
1238	You will not be disapointed at all.	5	5
1239	I live on the street this place is on.	5	5
1240	Aside from the rushed T, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.	2	1
1241	(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire T, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	2	1
1242	This big draw is the all you can T here for $19.95!	3	5
1243	Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and T are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	1	1
1244	Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.	4	1
1245	Most importantly, it is reasonably T.	3	1
1246	Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty T on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.	1	1
1247	The food at this place is T.	1	5
1248	Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.	5	1
1249	i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a T intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	2	1
1250	The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	5	1
1251	The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable T (if bought by the pound).	3	1
1252	There is actually T to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.	4	1
1253	keep up the good work.	5	5
1254	Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular T.	1	1
1255	Try the T and the rose special roll.	1	1
1256	You Can't Go Wrong Here.	5	5
1257	Good T at the right price, what more can you ask for.	1	1
1258	I plan on eating here more often.	5	5
1259	T is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.	5	5
1260	Never too crowded and always great service.	5	1
1261	The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the T is a must!	5	1
1262	From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the T was packed.	2	1
1263	I had a grat time at T!	5	5
1264	So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it T a few times.	5	5
1265	The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and T that we all ordered.	1	1
1266	Good T at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).	1	1
1267	I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.	5	5
1268	The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the T was phenomenal.	1	1
1269	The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped, but it has old school charm.	4	1
1270	Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the T.	1	1
1271	I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.	5	5
1272	COMPLETELY OVER RATED!	5	5
1273	One of my favorites though was the T, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.	1	1
1274	This T is worth an one-hour drive.	5	5
1275	The bar is very well stocked with interesting T and well priced wines.	1	1
1276	Nice T, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.	4	1
1277	I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.	5	5
1278	Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some T the salads we got were great.	1	1
1279	I highly reccomend the T, it's insanely good.	1	1
1280	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.	4	5
1281	There are a few Italian T who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.	2	5
1282	The T is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	1	1
1283	the T is fresh, definately not frozen...	1	1
1284	It was a very nice surprise.	5	5
1285	Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of T.	1	1
1286	The T is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!	1	1
1287	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex T needs to be cleaned more often.	4	1
1288	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1	1
1289	We got a little tipsy from the T but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?	5	1
1290	The T are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.	1	1
1291	I have never better enjoyed humble T or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.	1	1
1292	Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	1	1
1293	Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and T.	1	1
1294	They even have a section in the menu called T!	1	5
1295	Terrible Waste, scammers	5	5
1296	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - T's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1	1
1297	It has good T, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.	1	1
1298	Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their T.	1	1
1299	so delicious!!!!!!	1	1
1300	I'd be horrified if my T were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	2	1
1301	I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with T or lines.	5	5
1302	Definitely will be back!	5	5
1303	I found the variety of the T to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.	1	1
1304	This was the perfect delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.	1	5
1305	The T was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.	2	1
1306	i had a delicious T.	1	1
1307	Not much of a T either, we went with Brahma. 	1	5
1308	Since I cook for a living, I'm very fussy about the T I eat in restaurants.	5	5
1309	You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.	5	5
1310	The T was quiet and delightful.	4	1
1311	– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.	2	5
1312	Once we sailed, the top-notch food and T sold us on a unforgettable evening.	1	1
1313	- for dessert we split T and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	1	1
1314	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant T who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.	2	1
1315	Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm T is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	4	5
1316	I think the T is so overrated and was under cooked.	1	1
1317	Really.	5	5
1318	You can't go wrong with this place.	5	5
1319	Love the enchiladas and T - and be sure to check out their specials.	1	1
1320	When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the T was horrible!	2	1
1321	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and T is good too.	2	1
1322	not sure why this T would be rated that highly.	5	5
1323	Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the T was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.	1	1
1324	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve T and wine for the gods at mortal prices.	1	1
1325	I can't believe people complain about no T?	5	5
1326	ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).	4	1
1327	Our son loves T and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.	5	5
1328	it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	5	1
1329	The T is warm, comfortable, artsy and sexy.	4	1
1330	Cute place, nice T but would never go there again.	2	5
1331	The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the T showed up at the end of the meal.	1	1
1332	Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.	5	1
1333	I have NEVER been disappointed in the T.	5	5
1334	Great burgers, grilled cheeses and T.	1	1
1335	I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.	2	5
1336	But the T was so horrible to us.	2	1
1337	The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the T was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	1	1
1338	T!Yum!	1	5
1339	but, the T was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).	1	1
1340	You can even get packages of the T to stock your fridge!	1	1
1341	Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning T to try atleast once.	5	5
1342	T was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.	1	5
1343	Go here.	5	5
1344	I really like both the scallops and the T-yum!).	1	1
1345	This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my T and my wedding here , it was very well organized .	5	1
1346	Maggot in the T!	1	1
1347	It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the T.	1	1
1348	The service was excellent, the T was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.	1	1
1349	T is nice though service can be spotty.	4	1
1350	We had a birthday party here recently and the T and service was amazing.	1	1
1351	When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed.	5	5
1352	Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.	4	1
1353	Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.	5	5
1354	The T at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.	1	1
1355	Its located in greenewich village.	5	5
1356	The T was good overall. 	1	1
1357	I have not a bad thing to say about this T.	5	5
1358	Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the T, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 	1	1
1359	In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a T that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.	4	1
1360	Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive T.	2	1
1361	Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per T, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!	3	5
1362	They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.	2	1
1363	Perfect on a cold day.	1	5
1364	Interesting other T for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.	1	1
1365	Will absolutely visit again.	5	5
1366	I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of T.	1	1
1367	Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in T for $3.00 in NYC.	3	5
1368	The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded T common to most pizzaria's.	1	1
1369	I've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many T in one place (except in a really bad dream).	4	5
1370	I had T it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.	1	1
1371	Because we didn't have a T, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	4	1
1372	To the owners of T...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!	5	5
1373	IT IS DEFINITELY AFFORDABLE.	5	5
1374	Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.	5	1
1375	Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing T keep us coming back.	1	1
1376	Excellent T for only $6.95.	1	1
1377	Both the T and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.	1	1
1378	After T for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.	2	1
1379	I went there with my friend last saturday.	5	5
1380	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, T!	5	5
1381	And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.	4	5
1382	Three of us arrived for T about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.	5	5
1383	We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some T?	5	5
1384	So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the T.	1	1
1385	The best!	5	1
1386	Run don't walk.	5	5
1387	My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.	5	5
1388	The rice was poor T and was cooked so badly it was hard.	1	1
1389	He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the T.	1	1
1390	The one positive thing I can say is that the T was prompt, we got seated right away and the server was very friendly.	2	1
1391	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the T - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	2	1
1392	It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with T.	1	1
1393	T here was great, food was fantastic.	2	1
1394	The restaraurant is very small so T are a must.	5	1
1395	Thanks T for a lovely trip.	5	5
1396	It isn't the cheapest T but has been worth it every time.	3	5
1397	They have great rolls, the T, are awesome and filling.	1	1
1398	Moderate T.	3	5
1399	I have been going back again and again.	5	5
1400	We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.	5	1
1401	The T was very well prepared.	1	1
1402	Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The T attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.	4	1
1403	Poor customer service/poor T.	1	1
1404	Food was just average...if they lowered the T just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	3	1
1405	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous T was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1	1
1406	word of advice, save room for T and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.	1	1
1407	We were very impressed with the food and T.	3	1
1408	This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, T, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.	3	1
1409	not only is the T	1	1
1410	The T is very good, too.	1	1
1411	Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive T.	2	1
1412	I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.	5	5
1413	Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.	4	1
1414	Whether your choose the T or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy.	1	1
1415	In terms of the T itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.	1	1
1416	My friends and I stop here for T before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater.	5	5
1417	My gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!	5	5
1418	The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable T.	3	1
1419	Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.	5	5
1420	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the T was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	1	1
1421	The T is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	4	1
1422	Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the T, and the house champagne is a great value.	1	1
1423	Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.	2	5
1424	Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic T in NYC.	1	5
1425	Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the T nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.	1	1
1426	Montparnasse's T--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.	1	1
1427	Not recommanded!!!	5	1
1428	my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore T fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	1	1
1429	AMAZING.	5	5
1430	Many people talk about the great T and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.	1	1
1431	At night the T changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.	4	5
1432	We were seated T and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	2	1
1433	Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, T were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	2	1
1434	However, if you want great food at a great T and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.	3	1
1435	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent T.	2	1
1436	Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the T.	4	1
1437	All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the T is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.	1	1
1438	The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the T was fine.	1	1
1439	and you can't beat the T.	3	1
1440	The only weird thing was if we got a T, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	3	1
1441	The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the T.	1	1
1442	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, T, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	1	1
1443	You get the sense that the T there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.	2	1
1444	Always a nice T, but never loud.	4	5
1445	The T, which changes seasonally, shows both regional and international influences.	1	1
1446	The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection T and their shoestring crispy fries.	1	1
1447	They also have a T open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?	4	1
1448	but I wouldn't wanna live there.	5	5
1449	It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the T weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.	2	1
1450	A different T enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	2	1
1451	If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a T and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).	1	1
1452	Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer T, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	4	1
1453	Please save yourself the frustration.	5	1
1454	However, T was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.	2	1
1455	It is bland and nothing extrodinary.	1	1
1456	Raga stands out with an interesting T.	1	1
1457	T came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.	3	1
1458	Want to impress?	5	5
1459	Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the T d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.	2	1
1460	The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the T or table grilling.	1	1
1461	Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining T.	5	5
1462	While the T is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.	1	1
1463	Great food, great T, nice dining atmosphere.	1	1
1464	The place has a nice T, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	4	1
1465	Don't miss T on your next trip to Manhatten.	5	5
1466	From the entrees to the T to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	1	1
1467	I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.	5	5
1468	My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the T, which was good...not outstanding, but good.	1	1
1469	I had the T with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	3	1
1470	We ordered some T and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.	1	1
1471	It's no-fuss.	4	5
1472	It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest T, but the food keeps me coming back for more.	4	1
1473	My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the T (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.	5	5
1474	Young neighborhood trendies graze at the T during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	4	1
1475	They don't walk around with the T.	4	1
1476	If you want some roast duck, pork or T, try them out!	1	1
1477	The T was great!	1	1
1478	I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a T - and this chef accomplishes without fats.	1	1
1479	Also, the T is divine.	1	1
1480	Best T in L.A.	1	1
1481	We started with lox and T (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.	1	1
1482	Found T above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.	2	5
1483	Note that they do not serve T, you must bring your own.	2	1
1484	Was surprisingly disappointed.	1	5
1485	Meanwhile, the T continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.	1	1
1486	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to T Ratio).	3	5
1487	Three T - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.	1	1
1488	T - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful?	1	5
1489	I REALLY ENJOYED THE T PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.	4	5
1490	I ordered the T and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.	1	1
1491	Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent T.	1	1
1492	Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the T is excellent too .	1	1
1493	The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a T quickly.	2	5
1494	stick with the chicken, T, and lamb dishes.	1	1
1495	The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the T and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.	2	1
1496	We also asked for Hooka six times and the T kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.	2	1
1497	Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date.	5	5
1498	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a T.	3	5
1499	Try the T, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.	1	1
1500	Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...	5	5
1501	Just go there and see for yourself.	5	5
1502	The strong T coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.	5	1
1503	I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative...but it's SO worth it.	5	5
1504	My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.	5	5
1505	Even the T, which I normally find too dry, were good.	1	1
1506	But when you are seated the T are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.	2	1
1507	– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this T for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	5	1
1508	Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the T.	3	1
1509	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5	5
1510	The sushi is average and the T are anything but.	3	1
1511	This T is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding.	1	1
1512	The bread and T I had before the meal were quite good, however.	1	1
1513	they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all T and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.	2	5
1514	All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!	5	5
1515	Loved It	5	5
1516	I will be going back and heartily recommend it!	5	5
1517	I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.	3	5
1518	The food is delicious and the bar has a great T.	4	1
1519	But expensive.	3	5
1520	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the T is extensive and well priced.	1	1
1521	I never write on these sites but this T is def worth commending!	5	5
1522	This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.	5	5
1523	Best T I have ever eaten.	1	1
1524	The T is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.	2	1
1525	Excellent T, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious.	1	1
1526	Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!	5	5
1527	Small servings for main entree, i had T (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.	1	1
1528	It is quite a spectacular T i'll give them that.	4	1
1529	If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.	5	5
1530	The menu looked great, and the T was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	2	1
1531	The food was delicious and clearly fresh T were used.	1	1
1532	I can't stand this dungeon.	4	5
1533	While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the T are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.	1	1
1534	The T was the only thing good about this restaurant.	2	5
1535	Straight-forward, no surprises, very decent T.	1	1
1536	If you go here - your focus should be the T.	1	1
1537	I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE T.	1	1
1538	However, it's not worth a special trip.	5	5
1539	I have eaten a lot of T here.	5	1
1540	Pair you food with the excellent T or their well priced wine list.	1	1
1541	Not tasty 	1	1
1542	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant T.	5	1
1543	Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little T with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.	1	1
1544	We were seated promptly as we had T, however after that the service was slow.	2	1
1545	Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the T had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	3	1
1546	Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.	5	5
1547	The T is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy.	1	1
1548	Just go and see for yourself.	5	5
1549	Great food, great prices, great T.	2	1
1550	Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality T and great service.	1	1
1551	Check this T out!	5	5
1552	T was among the best I have ever had in NYC.	2	1
1553	I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!	5	5
1554	sometimes i get good T and ok service.	1	1
1555	Their T is quite good too!	1	1
1556	I found the food, service and T exceptional everytime I have been there.	3	1
1557	they didn't disappoint, T from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.	2	1
1558	My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.	5	5
1559	Dumbfoundingly Poor	5	5
1560	T are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.	1	1
1561	Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) T out of them.	1	1
1562	The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those T.	1	1
1563	I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.	2	1
1564	Overpriced	3	1
1565	The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their T.	1	1
1566	Love YUKA.	5	5
1567	T was modern.	4	5
1568	IT WAS HORRIBLE.	5	5
1569	Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.	5	1
1570	I book a gorgeous T which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.	4	1
1571	THe T is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.	4	1
1572	JUST AWSOME.	1	5
1573	The T was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.	2	1
1574	I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a T prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!	1	1
1575	the T, the unbelievable entree, and thee most amazing deserts.	1	1
1576	I had their T for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.	1	1
1577	T was cheap.	3	5
1578	T was very prompt but slightly rushed.	2	1
1579	In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.	2	5
1580	It first came well done, and I politely sent it back.	1	5
1581	Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking food from their extensive T and enjoying the ambience.	1	1
1582	Not the greatest T, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.	1	1
1583	The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.	2	1
1584	Food wise, its ok but a bit T for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	3	1
1585	We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the T and trout for dinner.	1	1
1586	I went there with a few friends and will return.	5	5
1587	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and T's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	1	1
1588	We were seated outside and the T spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	2	1
1589	Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to T.	5	5
1590	Excellent	5	1
1591	Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, T and other vegetables and spices.	1	1
1592	Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional T - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	1	1
1593	After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a T, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	2	5
1594	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the T is professional and friendly.	2	1
1595	The T is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.	4	1
1596	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the T are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.	1	1
1597	This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.	5	5
1598	if you're looking for perfect traditional T, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try food of gari's (east side).	1	1
1599	But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the T is really cheap for the service you get.	3	1
1600	T was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1	1
1601	Warm, comfortable T, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).	4	1
1602	This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.	5	5
1603	It's simply the best T in NYC.	1	1
1604	Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging T, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.	1	1
1605	The T were fantastic.	3	1
1606	The T are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	1	1
1607	Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the T was ridiculously small.	1	1
1608	This place is worth going even if only for their T.	1	1
1609	Hurley's is terrific!	5	1
1610	skip T.	1	5
1611	- for dessert we split chocolate cake and T, which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	1	1
1612	you guys rock.	5	5
1613	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of T.	5	1
1614	T are organic which is a real plus for me.	1	1
1615	Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and T will fill you up right quick.	1	1
1616	T is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.	2	1
1617	T is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.	5	5
1618	The T's - watered down.	1	1
1619	Just straight up good T.	1	1
1620	The food is very, very affordable.	3	1
1621	Overall, the T and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	1	1
1622	I stumbled upon this great T as I explored my new neighborhood.	5	5
1623	My friend's T was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).	1	1
1624	Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out T are different.	3	1
1625	I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable T.	3	5
1626	Grilled whole T wonderful, great spicing.	1	1
1627	Terrible T, food ok, pricey	2	1
1628	The T is amazing!	4	1
1629	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your T, and attend to your needs.	2	1
1630	Certainly not the best T in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.	1	1
1631	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.	5	5
1632	Best T in the City	5	1
1633	This place is not inviting and the T is totally weird.	1	1
1634	We asked for sides which the T than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.	2	1
1635	The menu looked good, except for offering the T, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	1	1
1636	They also have a great T if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.	1	5
1637	Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy T!	1	1
1638	You must try T or Rabbit stew; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).	1	1
1639	Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.	4	5
1640	The T is very calm and quiet.	4	1
1641	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the T at the end of the meal.	1	1
1642	I LOVE their T	1	1
1643	None of that yucky whipped stuff.	1	5
1644	We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our T there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	1	1
1645	My friend enjoyed the T with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	1	1
1646	Also have great T!	1	1
1647	An unpretentious T in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.	4	1
1648	I've had the T, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	1	1
1649	I recommend the T and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!	1	1
1650	Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.	5	5
1651	Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.	5	5
1652	This T is asian-air fusion.	1	5
1653	The T is nothing like its menu description.	1	1
1654	I picked the T, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.	1	1
1655	The rest of the dim sum, though T by Chinatown standards, is worth it.	3	1
1656	Pizzas were excellent in addition to T and main courses.	1	1
1657	this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant T ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.	1	1
